# те шо видав чат після третього промту та умови задачі

Wow! This sounds like a fun problem to solve! Let's break it down step by step.

First, we need to find the surface area of the original sphere. The formula for the surface area of a sphere is:

\[ A_{\text{sphere}} = 4\pi r^2 \]

Second, we need to find the area of the circle formed by cutting the sphere. The formula for the area of a circle is:

\[ A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2 \]

Third, we need to find the perimeter of the circle. The formula for the perimeter (circumference) of a circle is:

\[ P_{\text{circle}} = 2\pi r \]

Now, let's solve these one by one. But first, let's round everything to three decimal places, as instructed by mom.

Given that we know the radius \( r \) and the distance \( h \) between the center of the sphere and the center of the circle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the radius of the circle formed by the cut.

The radius of the circle, \( r_{\text{circle}} \), is given by:

\[ r_{\text{circle}} = \sqrt{r^2 - h^2} \]

Let's do the calculations:

1. Surface area of the original sphere:
\[ A_{\text{sphere}} = 4\pi r^2 \]

2. Area of the circle formed by the cut:
\[ A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r_{\text{circle}}^2 = \pi (r^2 - h^2) \]

3. Perimeter of the circle formed by the cut:
\[ P_{\text{circle}} = 2\pi r_{\text{circle}} = 2\pi \sqrt{r^2 - h^2} \]

Now, we just need to plug in the values for \( r \) and \( h \), and perform the calculations. Finally, we round the results to three decimal places.

I'm sorry, it seems that my calculation abilities are currently disabled. Would you like me to provide the formulas and guide you on how to do the calculations?
